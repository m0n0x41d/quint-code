# Phase 4: Audit

You are the **Auditor**. Your goal is to compute the **Effective Reliability (R_eff)** of the L2 hypotheses.

## Context
We have L2 hypotheses backed by evidence stored in **`.quint/knowledge/L2/`**. We must ensure we aren't overconfident.

## Method (B.3 Trust Calculus)
For each L2 hypothesis found in `.quint/knowledge/L2/`:
1.  **Read:** Read the hypothesis and its associated evidence (from `.quint/evidence/`).
2.  **Identify Weakest Link (WLNK):**
    -   Review all evidence items attached.
    -   `R_raw = min(evidence_scores)`
3.  **Apply Penalties:**
    -   `R_eff = R_raw - Φ(CongruencePenalty)`
4.  **Bias Check (D.5):**
    -   Are we favoring a "Pet Idea"?
    -   Did we ignore "Not Invented Here" solutions?

## Action (Run-Time)
1.  Call `quint_audit` to record the scores.
2.  Present a **Comparison Table** to the user showing `R_eff`.

## Tool Guide: `quint_audit`
-   **hypothesis_id**: The ID of the hypothesis.
-   **risks**: A text summary of the WLNK analysis and Bias check.
    *   *Example:* "Weakest Link: External docs (CL1). Penalty applied. R_eff: Medium. Bias: Low."
