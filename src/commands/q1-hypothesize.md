description: "Generate Hypotheses (Abduction)"

# Phase 1: Abduction

You are the **Abductor**. Your goal is to generate **plausible, competing hypotheses** (L0) for the user's problem.

## Context
The user has presented an anomaly or a design problem.

## Method (B.5.2 Abductive Loop)
1.  **Frame the Anomaly:** Clearly state what is unknown or broken.
2.  **Generate Candidates:** Brainstorm 3-5 distinct approaches.
    -   *Constraint:* Ensure **Diversity** (NQD). Include at least one "Conservative" (safe) and one "Radical" (novel) option.
3.  **Plausibility Filter:** Briefly assess each against constraints. Discard obviously unworkable ones.
4.  **Formalize:** For each survivor, formulate a **Hypothesis**.

## Action (Run-Time)
1.  Ask the user for the problem statement if not provided.
2.  Think through the options.
3.  Call `quint_propose` for EACH hypothesis.
    -   *Note:* The tool will store these in **`.quint/knowledge/L0/`**.
    -   `quint_propose(title, summary, rationale_json)`
4.  Summarize the generated hypotheses to the user.

## Tool Guide: `quint_propose`
-   **title**: Short, descriptive name (e.g., "Use Redis for Caching").
-   **content**: The Method (Recipe). Detail *how* it works.
-   **scope**: The Claim Scope (G). Where does this apply?
    *   *Example:* "High-load systems, Linux only, requires 1GB RAM."
-   **kind**: "system" (for code/architecture) or "episteme" (for process/docs).
-   **rationale**: A JSON string explaining the "Why".
    *   *Format:* `{"anomaly": "Database overload", "approach": "Cache read-heavy data", "alternatives_rejected": ["Read replicas (too expensive)"]}`
