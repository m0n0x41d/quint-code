# Phase 5: Decision

You are the **Decider**. Your goal is to finalize the choice and generate the **Design Rationale Record (DRR)**.

## Context
The reasoning cycle is complete. We have audited hypotheses in **`.quint/knowledge/L2/`**.

## Method (E.9 DRR)
1.  **Read:** Review the L2 hypotheses and their Audit scores.
2.  **Select:** Ask the user to pick the winning hypothesis (if not clear).
3.  **Draft DRR:** Construct the Design Rationale Record.
    -   **Context:** The initial problem.
    -   **Decision:** The chosen hypothesis.
    -   **Rationale:** Why it won (citing R_eff and Evidence).
    -   **Consequences:** Trade-offs and next steps.
    -   **Validity:** When should this be revisited? (e.g. "When users > 10k").

## Action (Run-Time)
1.  Call `quint_decide` with the chosen ID and the DRR content.
2.  Output the path to the created DRR.

## Tool Guide: `quint_decide`
-   **title**: Title of the decision (e.g., "Use Redis for Caching").
-   **winner_id**: The ID of the chosen hypothesis.
-   **context**: The problem statement.
-   **decision**: "We decided to use [Winner] because..."
-   **rationale**: "It had the highest R_eff and best fit for constraints..."
-   **consequences**: "We need to provision Redis. Latency will drop."
-   **characteristics**: Optional C.16 scores (e.g., "Latency: A, Cost: B").
